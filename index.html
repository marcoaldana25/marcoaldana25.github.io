		Hello! Thank you for visiting my Computer Science Capstone porfolio! The below contents will describe the work I've completed to re-engineer an existing application developed at Southern New Hampshire Univeristy as part of our course curriculum. It will be split into the following categories:
		<ul>
			<li>Performing a Code Review</li>
			<li>Narrative One: Software Design/Engineering</li>
			<li>Narrative Two: Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
			<li>Narrative Three: Databases</li>
			<li>Professional Self-Reflections</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h2>Performing a Code Review</h2>
	<p>
		In Milestone Two for CS-499, we performed a code review that covers the artifact details we plan to revist for the final project. Below is a video that captures me performing a code review 
		over my plans to incorperate Software Design/Engineering, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Databases into a cohesive final project.

	<h2>Narrative One: Software Design/Engineering Artifact</h2>
	<p>
		The original project I've decieded to re-engineer is a Python script that facilitates CRUD operations on a MongoDB database named 'Animals'.
		For my final project, I've opted to re-write this entire application and port it to a C# application written in .Net Core 3.1. Below is a overview of how the call chain now occurs within the applicaiton.<br/>

		As part of the re-engineering process, I've introducted a structure that will abstract the data layer away from the client layer. To do this, I've introduced three new projects within the solution. They are as follows
		<ul>
			<li>Animal Maintenance Client: Responsible for front end displays, injecting references, and application startup.</li>
			<li>Animal Maintenance Mangager: Responsible for directing workflow of application</li>
			<li>Animal Maintenance Accessor: Responsible for calling data source and facilitating database creation using Entity Framework</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h5>General Updates for the Software Design/Engineering Narrative</h5>
	<p>
		The intent of this narrative is to utilize the skills I've learned thus far as a Software Engineer and apply them to re-engineer an existing application. Some key points I'd like to address that I've accomplished as part of the project include the following
		<ul>
			<li>Creating more specifically named varaibles</li>
			<li>Covering the application with an appropriate level of Unit Test coverage</li>
			<li>Implement constructor based Dependency Injection to isolate code and remove hard dependencies</li>
			<li>Translate entire application into a C# driven app.</li>
		</ul>
		
		A link to the application as checked into GitHub source control can be seen <a href="https://github.com/marcoaldana25/marcoaldana25.github.io/tree/main/AnimalMaintenance/AnimalMaintenance_NetCore">Here</a>.
	</p>
	<h2>Narrative Two: Data Structures and Algorithms</h2>
	<p>
		For the second narrative in our final project, we will cover my changes made to the CS-340 Client/Server Development Animal Maintenance application and how I've introduced a data strucure that previously was not there. For the original project, we used a MongoDB database connection and populated an 'Animals' collection using a provided Excel sheet per the class materials. This provided us with essentially no flexibility in terms of how we managed or manipulated the data.
		
		<h4>Animal Data Structure</h4>
		The Animal Data Transfer Object I will be referring to can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/marcoaldana25/marcoaldana25.github.io/blob/main/AnimalMaintenance/AnimalMaintenance_NetCore/2.%20Managers/AnimalMaintenance.Managers/DataTransferObjects/Animal.cs">here</a>
		I've defined the animal strucutre for my application as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>Id: Primary Key. Also used to easily update an existing entity, or delete an existing entity.</li>
			<li>Animal Type: Used as a means to identify the animal (Dog, Cat, etc.)</li>
			<li>Breed: Used to specify further information on the animal being maintained.</li>
			<li>Color: Basic color of the animal</li>
			<li>Date of Birth: Estimated Date of Birth of the animal being maintained</li>
			<li>Income Type: Not Required, used as a means to keep track of how the animal was obtained.</li>
			<li>Sex Upon Income: Not Required, used as a means to keep track of what sex the animal originally came in as.</li>
			<li>Outcome Type: Not Required, used as a means to keep track of the outcome of the animal (Adoption, etc).</li>
			<li>Sex Upon Outcome: Not Required, used as a means to keep track of the outgoing sex of the animal.</li>
		</ul>
		</br>
		Each property on the Animal Data Structure contains a display attribute which is used for the user interface. An example of what the animal user interface looks like can be seen below:

	</p>
	<h4>Algorithms</h4>
	<p>
		The algorithms within this application are nothing revolutionary. They are merely an attempt at re-engineering the existing behavior from the original Python script into a .Net Core 3.1 application. Most of the work revolves around basic Create Read Update and Delete functions which live in the Accessor layer of the application. Here is a link to the Accessor class which is responsible for the main functionality of the application - <a href="https://github.com/marcoaldana25/marcoaldana25.github.io/blob/main/AnimalMaintenance/AnimalMaintenance_NetCore/3.%20Accessors/AnimalMaintenance.Accessors/AnimalMaintenanceAccessor.cs">AnimalMaintenanceAccessor.cs</a>
		The methods within this class are as follow:
		<ul>
			<li>GetAnimals: Responsible for returning a list of all present animals within the AnimalMaintenance database.</li>
			<li>GetAnimal: Responsible for returning a single animal from the AnimalMaintenance database with the corresponding Id.</li>
			<li>AddAnimal: Responsible for adding a new animal record into the AnimalMaintenance database.</li>
			<li>UpdateAnimal: Responsible for updating an existing animal record in the Animal Maintenance database.</li>
			<li>DeleteAnimal: Responsible for removing an existing animal record in the Animal Maintenance database.</li>
		</ul>
		One of the standards I've learned within my time at Southern New Hampshire University is the importance of comments within code. Comments act as a quick way for others to understand what a certain function is doing. Although the functions I've introduced here are fairly self-explanatory through naming conventions, I have added method level comments on what these functions do onto the interface that AnimalMaintenanceAccessor.cs inherits from. The reasoning on doing this instead of the actual class itself is that adding the method comments on the interface level allow the comments to appear when implementing it in the code. The interface for AnimalMaintenanceAccessor.cs can be seen <a href="https://github.com/marcoaldana25/marcoaldana25.github.io/blob/main/AnimalMaintenance/AnimalMaintenance_NetCore/3.%20Accessors/AnimalMaintenance.Accessors/IAnimalMaintenanceAccessor.cs">here.</a>
