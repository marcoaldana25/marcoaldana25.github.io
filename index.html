	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	<h3>Performing a Code Review</h3>
	<p>
		In Milestone Two for CS-499, we performed a code review that covers the artifact details we plan to revist for the final project. Below is a video that captures me performing a code review 
		over my plans to incorperate Software Design/Engineering, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Databases into a cohesive final project.

	<p>

		For my final project, I've opted to re-write this entire application and port it to a C# application written in .Net Core 3.1. Below is a overview of how the call chain now occurs within the applicaiton.<br/>
