		Hello! Thank you for visiting my Computer Science Capstone porfolio! The below contents will describe the work I've completed to re-engineer an existing application developed at Southern New Hampshire Univeristy as part of our course curriculum. It will be split into the following categories:
		<ul>
			<li>Performing a Code Review</li>
			<li>Narrative One: Software Design/Engineering</li>
			<li>Narrative Two: Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
			<li>Narrative Three: Databases</li>
			<li>Professional Self-Reflections</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h3>Performing a Code Review</h3>
	<p>
		In Milestone Two for CS-499, we performed a code review that covers the artifact details we plan to revist for the final project. Below is a video that captures me performing a code review 
		over my plans to incorperate Software Design/Engineering, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Databases into a cohesive final project.

	<h3>Narrative One: Software Design/Engineering Artifact</h3>
	<p>
		The original project I've decieded to re-engineer is a Python script that facilitates CRUD operations on a MongoDB database named 'Animals'.
		For my final project, I've opted to re-write this entire application and port it to a C# application written in .Net Core 3.1. Below is a overview of how the call chain now occurs within the applicaiton.<br/>

		As part of the re-engineering process, I've introducted a structure that will abstract the data layer away from the client layer. To do this, I've introduced three new projects within the solution. They are as follows
		<ul>
			<li>Animal Maintenance Client: Responsible for front end displays, injecting references, and application startup.</li>
			<li>Animal Maintenance Mangager: Responsible for directing workflow of application</li>
			<li>Animal Maintenance Accessor: Responsible for calling data source and facilitating database creation using Entity Framework</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h5>General Updates for the Software Design/Engineering Narrative</h5>
	<p>
		The intent of this narrative is to utilize the skills I've learned thus far as a Software Engineer and apply them to re-engineer an existing application. Some key points I'd like to address that I've accomplished as part of the project include the following
		<ul>
			<li>Creating more specifically named varaibles</li>
			<li>Covering the application with an appropriate level of Unit Test coverage</li>
			<li>Implement constructor based Dependency Injection to isolate code and remove hard dependencies</li>
			<li>Translate entire application into a C# driven app.</li>
		</ul>
		
		A link to the application as checked into GitHub source control can be seen <a href="https://github.com/marcoaldana25/marcoaldana25.github.io/tree/main/AnimalMaintenance/AnimalMaintenance_NetCore">Here</a>.
