		Hello! Thank you for visiting my Computer Science Capstone porfolio! The below contents will describe the work I've completed to re-engineer an existing application developed at Southern New Hampshire Univeristy as part of our course curriculum. It will be split into the following categories:
		<ul>
			<li>Performing a Code Review</li>
			<li>Narrative One: Software Design/Engineering</li>
			<li>Narrative Two: Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
			<li>Narrative Three: Databases</li>
			<li>Professional Self-Reflections</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h3>Performing a Code Review</h3>
	<p>
		In Milestone Two for CS-499, we performed a code review that covers the artifact details we plan to revist for the final project. Below is a video that captures me performing a code review 
		over my plans to incorperate Software Design/Engineering, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Databases into a cohesive final project.

	<h3>Narrative One: Software Design/Engineering Artifact</h3>
	<p>
		The original project I've decieded to re-engineer is a Python script that facilitates CRUD operations on a MongoDB database named 'Animals'.
		For my final project, I've opted to re-write this entire application and port it to a C# application written in .Net Core 3.1. Below is a overview of how the call chain now occurs within the applicaiton.<br/>

		As part of the re-engineering process, I've introducted a structure that will abstract the data layer away from the client layer. To do this, I've introduced three new projects within the solution. They are as follows
		<ul>
			<li>Animal Maintenance Client: Responsible for front end displays, injecting references, and application startup.</li>
			<li>Animal Maintenance Mangager: Responsible for directing workflow of application</li>
			<li>Animal Maintenance Accessor: Responsible for calling data source and facilitating database creation using Entity Framework</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h5>General Updates for the Software Design/Engineering Narrative</h5>
	<p>
		The intent of this narrative is to utilize the skills I've learned thus far as a Software Engineer and apply them to re-engineer an existing application. Some key points I'd like to address that I've accomplished as part of the project include the following
		<ul>
			<li>Creating more specifically named varaibles</li>
			<li>Covering the application with an appropriate level of Unit Test coverage</li>
			<li>Implement constructor based Dependency Injection to isolate code and remove hard dependencies</li>
			<li>Translate entire application into a C# driven app.</li>
		</ul>
		
		A link to the application as checked into GitHub source control can be seen <a href="https://github.com/marcoaldana25/marcoaldana25.github.io/tree/main/AnimalMaintenance/AnimalMaintenance_NetCore">Here</a>.

	<h3>Narrative Two: Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
	<p>
		For the second narrative in our final project, we will cover my changes made to the CS-340 Client/Server Development Animal Maintenance application and how I've introduced a data strucure that previously was not there. For the original project, we used a MongoDB database connection and populated an 'Animals' collection using a provided Excel sheet per the class materials. This provided us with essentially no flexibility in terms of how we managed or manipulated the data.
		
		<h4>Animal Data Structure</h4>
		I've defined the animal strucutre for my application as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>Id: Primary Key. Also used to easily update an existing entity, or delete an existing entity.</li>
			<li>Animal Type: Used as a means to identify the animal (Dog, Cat, etc.)</li>
			<li>Breed: Used to specify further information on the animal being maintained.</li>
			<li>Color: Basic color of the animal</li>
			<li>Date of Birth: Estimated Date of Birth of the animal being maintained</li>
			<li>Income Type: Not Required, used as a means to keep track of how the animal was obtained.</li>
			<li>Sex Upon Income: Not Required, used as a means to keep track of what sex the animal originally came in as.</li>
			<li>Outcome Type: Not Required, used as a means to keep track of the outcome of the animal (Adoption, etc).</li>
			<li>Sex Upon Outcome: Not Required, used as a means to keep track of the outgoing sex of the animal.</li>
		</ul>
		</br>
		Each property on the Animal Data Structure contains a display attribute which is used for the user interface. An example of what the animal user interface looks like can be seen below:
